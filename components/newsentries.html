            <h3 class="newsitem-headline">Announcing CoVis - a new tool to discover reliable COVID-19 research</h3>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                For the development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, scientists depend on valid knowledge on the coronavirus. But finding reliable research results is often difficult: with over 20,000 papers published on the topic, scientists spend a lot of valuable time reviewing the literature.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Today, we are excited to announce the release of CoVis: a curated knowledge map of seminal works on COVID-19. Developed in collaboration with our partner <a href="https://refigure.org" target="_blank" class="underline">ReFigure</a>, CoVis provides a quick overview of research articles from eight particularly relevant areas of biomedical research. When key issues are not answered by a single research source, data and images from multiple sources are compiled into a visual dashboard called a ReFigure. 
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
               <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/covis" target="_blank" class="underline">
            CoVis
        </a> makes it easier to get started on the topic - but also helps you to stay up-to-date. In order to do justice to the rapid development of COVID-19 research, the database is extended regularly by a dedicated team of curators led by immunologists and ReFigure founders Dr. Girija Goyal and Dr. James Akin. 
               We are also inviting subject-matter experts to contribute to CoVis. Find out more about <a href="covis/contact-us" target="_blank" class="underline">the contribution process here</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                The tool is financially supported by the EU project <a href="https://eoscsecretariat.eu" target="_blank" class="underline">EOSC Secretariat</a> as part of the COVID-19 Fast-Track Funding.
                For further information, please <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/doc/CoVis_Press-Release_20200623.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">see the full press release</a>. As always, we look forward to your input and feedback!

            <h3 class="newsitem-headline">Call for Contributions: "Overcoming the Discoverability Crisis"</h3>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
Covid-19 has exposed a host of issues with the current scholarly communication system, also with regard to the discoverability of scientific knowledge. Many research groups have pivoted to coronavirus research without prior experience or adequate preparation. They were immediately confronted with having to identify relevant knowledge from unfamiliar (sub-)disciplines, while needing to keep up with the rapid growth of data and publications. Both challenges currently pose big problems for researchers, leading to delays, duplicated work, and findings that are based on questionable results. Observing the many shortcomings of discovery workflows in the course of Covid-19 confirms that discoverability itself is in crisis.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                That’s why Open Knowledge Maps and <a href="https://refigure.org/ReFigure" target="_blank" class="underline">Refigure</a> are hosting an Open Publishing Fest session entitled “Overcoming the discoverability crisis”. On <strong>May 27th at 10:00 EDT (=16:00 CEST, 21:00 WIB)</strong>, we want to discuss the issues and challenges, but also highlight various discovery approaches that have emerged in the course of the Covid-19 pandemic (or already before). In particular, we want to showcase the potential of open infrastructures for the development of innovative discovery solutions.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                The two-hour online event will be divided into three sections: we will kick off with reports from researchers, librarians and practitioners on real-life discovery workflows in the Covid-19 pandemic and the problems associated with it. Second, we invite open infrastructures and open source toolmakers to present potential solutions. Third, we will host a discussion on what is needed from a systemic point of view to overcoming the discoverability crisis.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                <strong>We invite contributions to all three parts. Those interested in either</strong>
            </p>

            <ul class="news-list">
                <li><strong>(1) giving a report on current discovery workflows,</strong></li>
                <li><strong>(2) presenting a tool or infrastructure, or</strong></li> 
                <li><strong>(3) giving a short input on the systemic problems of discovery,</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                <strong>please send a brief outline on the proposed contribution to Peter Kraker (<a href="mailto:pkraker@openknowledgemaps.org" class="underline">pkraker@openknowledgemaps.org</a>) until May 22nd.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Depending on the number of interested contributors, we may have to cap the number of presentations at a certain point. We will, however, provide a collaborative document where everyone can give their input.

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We are excited to announce a new partnership with <a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank" class="underline">eLife</a> to improve our technology platform.  With eLife's backing, we will perform a necessary refactoring of the Open Knowledge Maps frontend.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                The refactoring will improve the serviceability, reusability and structure of our frontend. The aim is to make it easier to introduce new functionality crucial to fulfilling important use cases, such as integrating Open Knowledge Maps into user workflows, enabling future integrations (e.g. of dataset indices), and reaching our goal of a <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/about#our-vision" target="_blank" class="underline">collaborative discovery environment</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                This is the latest collaboration under eLife's <a href="https://elifesciences.org/about/innovation" target="_blank" class="underline">Innovation Initiative</a>, aimed at supporting open-source projects in the research discovery and communication space.
                eLife and Open Knowledge Maps have come together through a common commitment to speed up research dissemination and curation.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="newsitem-blockquote"><em>"We are proud to be able to endorse an organisation whose ethos encompasses our core values of openness, collaboration and reuse,"</em> says Emmy Tsang, eLife Innovation Community Manager. <em>"We understand the importance of open-source project maintenance, as well as the lack of funding and support in this area, and are excited to contribute to the continuity of this innovative initiative. It will be great to work with the Open Knowledge Maps team and exchange ideas on the use of machine-learning and web technologies to drive forward research discovery, sharing and consumption."</em></blockquote>
            <blockquote class="newsitem-blockquote"><em>"We're very excited to have eLife’s support for this project,"</em> adds Peter Kraker, Founder and Chairman of Open Knowledge Maps. <em>"This work is crucial for implementing new features, which is in turn important for the success of our supporting membership program. eLife’s backing gives us a unique opportunity to improve our growth and sustainability that might have been difficult to come by elsewhere."</em></blockquote>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                More insight into the refactoring project can be found in the accompanying <a href="https://elifesciences.org/labs/ef274c83/open-knowledge-maps-a-visual-interface-to-the-world-s-scientific-knowledge" target="_blank" class="underline">blog post</a> on eLife Labs.

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We are delighted to announce that Open Knowledge Maps has won the <a class="underline" href="https://freieswissen.net/einreichung.html" target="_blank">Austrian Prize for Free Knowledge</a> of Wikimedia Austria in the category civic engagement. The prize is awarded to individuals and organisations that make outstanding contributions to free knowledge. In their rationale, the jury appreciated Open Knowledge Maps for making scientific knowledge better discoverable and more reusable - also for those who are not employed at an academic institution.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                The prize was awarded by <a class="underline" href="https://wikimedia.at" target="_blank">Wikimedia Austria</a> on January 25th at the <a class="underline" href="https://www.wissenschaftsball.at/en/" target="_blank">Vienna Ball of Sciences</a> in attendance of the Mayor of Vienna, Michael Ludwig, and the Austrian Federal Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology, Leonore Gewessler. 
                Our fellow prize winners are also strongly related to open science: the <a class="underline" href="https://fwf.ac.at/en/" target="_blank">Austrian Science Fund (FWF)</a>, one of the most progressive funding organisations when it comes to open science (organisation of the year), and early open access pioneer <a class="underline" href="https://www2.isds.tugraz.at/maurer" target="_blank">Hermann Maurer</a> (lifetime achievement prize).
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                We are honored to be recognized with this prize. We want to thank our team and community for their hard work and for their continued support. Without you, none of this would be possible. We are very happy and thankful to have you with us!

            <h3 class="newsitem-headline">What's  next for Open Knowledge Maps?</h3>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                It’s been a busy year at Open Knowledge Maps! We made two major updates to our software that led to a considerable increase in user engagement. We launched our supporting membership model and we initiated the GO FAIR Discovery network. We continued our Enthusiasts program and we developed a new workshop format to help researchers improve the visibility of their research online - and <a class="underline" href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/news" target="_blank">so much more</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We also realized that our roadmap doesn’t reflect the complexity of Open Knowledge Maps’ vision any longer. We have grown as an organisation and improved our services considerably since we last updated the document in 2017.
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                Following a complete overhaul of our roadmap, we are now happy to announce the <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/open-discovery/blob/master/roadmap.md" target="_blank">new and improved version</a>. As always, the feedback from our community was front and center when considering what’s coming next for Open Knowledge Maps.
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                Let’s take a look at some of the highlights:

            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                <strong> Firstly, better connect OKMaps to the services you already use and love:
                </strong>

            </p>

            <ul class='newsitem-p' style='list-style: disc; margin-left: 20px;'>
                <li>Enable exporting citations to Zotero</li>
                <li>Include links to additional open access copies (via unpaywall)</li>
                <li>Include Open Access Button for papers you still can’t access</li>
                <li>Include the DOAJ Seal of Approval and links to ORCiDs</li>
            </ul>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>

                These features will improve access to research documents, provide more context to individual outputs and better integrate Open Knowledge Maps into your discovery workflow.
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                <strong>Secondly, improve our capabilities for data discovery:</strong>

                Our role as lead in the GO FAIR Implementation Network "Discovery" puts us in a unique position to work closely with the community on better solutions for discovering data sets.
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>
                <strong>And finally:</strong>
                We are going to improve our financial, technical and organisational sustainability. We will provide access to our underlying data sets and continue our community, training &amp; networking activities.
            </p>

            <p class='newsitem-p'>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We are excited to announce that we are part of TRIPLE, an EU project funded under the Horizon 2020 framework. TRIPLE's goal is to create a comprehensive free and open discovery solution for the social sciences and humanities (SSH). Under the lead of Huma-Num (CNRS), a consortium of 18 partners from 12 countries will develop TRIPLE as a core service of OPERAS and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Starting this month, TRIPLE will run for 3.5 years.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Open Knowledge Maps will provide the textual and visual search components of the platform. We are excited to contribute to a project that will enable better discovery for disciplines that are usually neglected by mainstream discovery tools. TRIPLE will also benefit our users from all disciplines, as features developed in the project will also be included on <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org" target="_blank" class="underline">openknowledgemaps.org</a>.

            <h3 class="newsitem-headline">Welcome to our new partner Scientific Knowledge Services</h3>


            <p class="newsitem-p">
                At Open Knowledge Maps, we strive to foster and grow our community. We are therefore excited to announce a partnership with <a href="https://www.knowledge.services/" target="_blank" class="underline">Scientific Knowledge Services (SKS)</a>, the European service provider for research and research support organizations. We collaborate with SKS to raise awareness for discovery infrastructures for open science and to highlight the importance of investing in their future. SKS becomes official membership recruitment partner of Open Knowledge Maps and will support us in implementing our collaborative funding model.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                <em>“We are delighted to partner with Scientific Knowledge Services. SKS are a trusted partner in the scholarly communication system, and their activities in the areas of open science and citizen science strongly align with Open Knowledge Maps' vision and goals,”</em> says Peter Kraker, founder and chairman of Open Knowledge Maps. <em>“At Open Knowledge Maps, we believe that everyone should be able to benefit from scientific knowledge. We are confident that the partnership with SKS will help us to grow our organization so that we can achieve this goal.”</em>
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                <em>“Open Science is a movement that reflects a magnificent cultural change in research and in society. Research activities should be discoverable across the research landscape. Open Knowledge Maps is an organization that demonstrated to have a fundamental role in increasing the visibility of research outputs and improving collaboration between researchers and institutions. They challenge the traditional discovery tools, based on SERPs (search engine results pages) and propose to create maps of knowledge that provide more comprehensive overviews. Like all nonprofit organizations, Open Knowledge Maps needs support to reach sustainability, which is yet to be found. In my opinion, such support is part of the Open Science Responsibility; to make science irreversibly open, more reliable and to leave it in good shape for our next generations. As a small company, we enter with humbleness and ambition in this partnership with Open Knowledge Maps and we invite the research community to support their efforts,”</em> says Tiberius Ignat, the director of Scientific Knowledge Services.

                The Open Science Conference in Berlin is an international conference dedicated to the Open Science movement and provides a unique forum for a wide variety of stakeholders
                to discuss the present and the future of Open Science.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">


                Open Knowledge Maps founder Peter Kraker will give an invited talk at the conference about his <strong>#DontLeaveItToGoogle</strong> campaign.
                Peter will show that closed and proprietary infrastructures do not only limit the accessibility of research, but also prevent discoverability.
                He will discuss how open source services and non-profit frontends such as Open Knowledge Maps help overcome this issue and provide continuous innovation along the research workflow.

            <h3 class="newsitem-headline">Open Knowledge Maps coordinates new network to improve research data discovery</h3>


            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Research data are among the fastest growing openly accessible scientific outputs on the web. Unfortunately,
                the discoverability of this data is seriously lacking, leaving up to 85% of datasets unused.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">


                This is why Open Knowledge Maps has started a new implementation network (IN) that aims to change this.
                The main purpose of the Discovery IN is to provide open interfaces and other user-facing services for data discovery across disciplines.
                It brings together many well-known organisation and projects working on FAIR data (short for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data),
                including DataCite, OpenAIRE, EUDAT, OPERAS, CESSDA, BASE, CORE, ZBW, and Know-Center.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                The network is part of the <strong>GO FAIR</strong> initiative, a bottom-up international approach for the practical implementation of infrastructures for FAIR data, such as the EOSC (European Open Science Cloud).

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We are working on a <a target="_blank" href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/supporting-membership">membership-based funding model</a>. In this model, organisations become supporting members of
                Open Knowledge Maps and provide an annual contribution. We are happy to announce that our very first supporting member, the <a href="https://www.lbg.ac.at/" target="_blank" class="underline">Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft (LBG)</a>, has joined us. LBG is a longtime collaborator and is now also pioneering this promising path to sustainability with us. Welcome on board!
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">

                The <a href="https://www.lbg.ac.at/" target="_blank" class="underline">Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft (LBG)</a> is a research institution with a thematic focus on medicine, life sciences and the humanities, and is specifically targeting new research topics in Austria. Together with academic and implementing partners, the LBG is currently running 21 institutes and develops and tests new forms of collaboration between science and non-scientific actors such as companies, the public sector and civil society. Socially relevant challenges, to which research can contribute, are to be recognized at an early stage and taken up.
                The <a href="https://ois.lbg.ac.at/" target="_blank" class="underline">LBG Open Innovation in Science Center</a>, which unlocks the potential of open innovation for science, and the LBG Career Center, which supports 200 PhD students and postdocs, are part of the LBG.

                To provide a sustainable platform for open discovery, we propose to fund Open Knowledge Maps in a collective effort. Donations are part of this plan, which is why we ran our first donation campaign last December. The results make us very happy; with the funds donated, we are able to cover our server costs for 2019. Many thanks for your contributions and all the supportive messages!
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Of course, we also accept donations throughout the year.

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                As a charitable non-profit, we depend on our community. Thanks to your support, Open Knowledge Maps has become the largest visual search engine for scientific knowledge in the world.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Today, we ask you for your help with our next challenge: to ensure the sustainability of this platform. This is why we are launching our very first donation campaign. It is pretty simple:
                <b>If every user gave €3, we could run Open Knowledge Maps for a whole year.</b> 
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                With your help, we can not only keep Open Knowledge Maps online, but also develop it further. 
                With your donation you contribute to an open, ad-free discovery service that is used by hundreds of thousands 
                of people around the world. But we do not want to stop there: our goal is to develop Open Knowledge Maps 
                <a href="https://vimeo.com/188647919" target="_blank">into a collaborative system</a>, so that we can all 
                build on top of each others' knowledge.
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We hope that you’ll consider how useful it is to be able to discover scientific knowledge. 
                Not only for a select few, but for everyone on the planet. <b>The price of a coffee is all it takes!</b>
            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">

                Have you ever wanted to share a map with the readers of your blog? Reuse an OKMaps overview on your course website? Provide a collection of your favourite maps for your lab?
                Here’s the the good news: Now you can!
            </p>
            <ul class="newsitem-p">
                <li><b>Step 1:</b> Click on the embed button next to a map.</li>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b> Copy the code snippet.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b> And finally include it on your website. That’s it!</li>

            </ul>

                What do snakes and the visualization of research projects have in common? The answer is: <b>VIPER</b>. VIPER stands for <b>VI</b>sual <b>P</b>roject <b>E</b>xplore<b>R</b>, a unique open science application that focuses on the discovery of research project results. VIPER will enable you to systematically explore a project's output and to understand its impact in different areas.
            </p>
            <p class="newsitem-p">
                VIPER is made possible thanks to <a href="http://openaire.eu" target="_blank">OpenAIRE</a>, a key infrastructure that enables the European transition to open science.
                At the end of 2017, OpenAIRE launched an open call for tenders, seeking innovative ideas that would improve the OpenAIRE infrastructure services and/or their overall uptake.
                We are delighted to announce that Open Knowledge Maps's proposal has been among the 5 winning bids.
            </p>
            <p class="newsitem-p">
                To realize this idea, we will create knowledge maps for more than 700.000 projects by 15 funding agencies in OpenAIRE's massive database. VIPER exploits a unique property of OpenAIRE data:
                the link between projects and publications and datasets. Stay tuned for more infos and updates!

                At Open Knowledge Maps, we support this goal, because we believe 
                that open and collaborative processes will change the way we explore 
                and discover research. As a first measure, we have enabled open annotation 
                of all PDFs within our interface by integrating Hypothes.is into our 
                "Preview PDF" window.

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                We are happy to announce that Open Knowledge Maps is now connected to one of the largest academic search engines in the world: BASE.<br><br>

                For the first time you are able to visualize a research topic in any discipline. In addition, you can now search within different types of resources, including datasets and software. We would like to thank the <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/about_team.php?menu=2" target="_blank">BASE team</a> for their outstanding support in making this happen!<br><br>

                We have also spent a lot of time improving the naming of the sub-areas to make the concepts in a field more visible - which means that this update improves our existing PubMed integration too.<br><br>

                As always, we welcome any feedback you may have! 

            </p>

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Great things have happened following our launch of the DOAJ and PubMed 
                integrations. We saw a broad coverage on the web, including an appearance on the Reddit front 
                page in early November and an article in c't magazine. More than 44,000 people visited 
                Open Knowledge Maps in November, and almost 25,000 maps have been created to date.<br><br>
                We have also introduced Open Knowledge Maps at numerous events including MozFest, OpenCon & OpenCon Berlin, and NetzPat Vienna to name just a few. In total, over 230 people attended our workshops and sessions. The positive feedback was overwhelming and we want to thank our emerging community for their great support. Loads of you have posted great comments, written articles and spread Open Knowledge Maps in your respective communities, posted issues and ideas on Github, or become part of the team and advisory board. A BIG THANK YOU! We are happy to see everyone getting involved and we are also thinking about new ways to make it even easier for you to be part of the Open Knowledge Maps community in the future. Together we can revolutionize discovery!

            <p class="newsitem-p">
                Over the summer, we have been working hard to provide you with visualizations that 
                cover broader content sources. Now, our integration of PubMed and the Directory of 
                Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is finally here.<br><br>
                This means that you are now able to search 
                within more than 28 million articles. In addition, we have completely overhauled our 
                design and improved the user experience considerably - including the integration of 
                the open annotation software Hypothes.is in our PDF preview. Try it out and let us 
                know what you think!
