            We want to create a <a class="underline" href="community-guidelines" target="_blank">respectful, sustainable and inclusive space</a> for everyone involved in exploration and discovery of scientific knowledge.
            To achieve this goal, we depend on people from all over the world, who are passionate about better and more open solutions for discovery. <b>People like you!</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As an enthusiast, you'll play a critical role in shaping Open Knowledge Maps. You'll be:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">#1 Spreading the word</span> on Open Knowledge Maps in workshops and events</li>
            <li><span class="bold">#2 Providing input</span> on different aspects of Open Knowledge Maps</li>
            <li><span class="bold">#3 Reporting feedback</span> from your community.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You'll receive support from the Open Knowledge Maps team throughout your time in the program. 
            Being an enthusiast means that you will be named on our website and that you will get Open Knowledge Maps swag delivered to your doorstep.            
            And most importantly, you will connect with awesome people from different disciplines and backgrounds from all around the world.
