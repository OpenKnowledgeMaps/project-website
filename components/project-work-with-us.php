Together with you,             we will then create a concept based on our open source software             to make your resources available to the public. Afterwards, we set up             an agile process to implement the concept that involves feedback and user tests.             Depending on the available budget, this process usually involves several iterations.         </p>        <p>This ensures that the final visualizations will meet the needs of your users,             highlight the value of your collection and make your resources easily accessible for an open science.         </p>                <p>Get in touch at <a class="underline" href="mailto:info@openknowledgemaps.org">info@openknowledgemaps.org</a> with your project proposal ideas!                    <div class="try-now">            <a class="become-enthusiast" href="mailto:info@openknowledgemaps.org">Collaborate with us!</a>        </div>    </div></div>
