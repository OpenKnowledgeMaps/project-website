                <p>An Open Knowledge Maps visualization presents you with a topical overview for your search term.

                <p>We use text similarity to create the knowledge maps.
                    The algorithm groups those papers together that have many words in common.

                <p>The visualization is intended to give you a head start on your 
                    literature search. You can also use Open Knowledge Maps to stay up-to-date - 
                    just limit your search to the most recent papers in the options.
