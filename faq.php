                        <span id="question-Q">Q2</span> Why are you only using the top 100 papers to create the map?
                    </p>
                    <p>We want to keep the number of papers to a manageable amount. 
                        100 papers are already 10 times more content than is presented on a standard search results page.
                        Nevertheless, we are investigating on how to enable the exploration of larger amounts of content, 
                        while keeping <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load" target="_blank">cognitive load</a> to a minimum.
                        At the moment, you can drill deeper into a topic by providing a more specific search query.
                        One way to do this is to expand your query with the topic of a sub-area.

                        <span id="question-Q">Q3</span> Why are there important papers missing in my map?
                    </p>
                    <p>At the moment, we are using the <a href="#faq-top-100" class="underline">top 100 papers</a> from the selected data source to create the map.
                        While this is already 10 times more content than is presented on a standard search results page, we may still miss important 
                        papers due to this restriction. In addition, we can only use papers that have an abstract - otherwise we do not have enough content
                        for our <a href="#faq-automatic-analysis" class="underline">automatic analysis</a>.
                        <br>In the future, we hope to overcome this problem by including more papers in a map 
                        and by enabling users to <a target="_blank" class="underline" href="https://vimeo.com/188647919">manually add papers to automatically created maps</a>.

                        <span id="question-Q">Q4</span> Are the maps generated based on full text analysis or on metadata analysis?
                    </p>
                    <p>The grouping of papers is based on article metadata. Currently, we use titles, abstracts, authors, 
                        journals, and subject keywords to create a word co-occurrence matrix between articles. On top of this
                        matrix, we perform clustering and ordination algorithms. 
                        The labels for the sub-areas (bubbles) are generated from the subject keywords of the articles in this area. 
                        In cases where they are missing from the metadata, we approximate them from abstract and title.

                        <span id="question-Q">Q5</span> What does the placement of the bubbles and the papers mean?
                    </p>
                    <p>In general, the placement of bubbles can be interpreted as follows:
                    <ul class="faq-bullet-list">
                        <li>Closeness of bubbles implies subject similarity. The closer two bubbles, the closer they are subject-wise. 
                            The overlap of two bubbles implies strong subject similarity, but it does not mean that the two bubbles share common papers.
                            Papers are always assigned to a single bubble only.</li>
                        <li>Centrality of bubbles implies subject similarity with the rest of the map, not importance. 
                            The closer a bubble is to the center, the closer it is subject-wise to all the other bubbles in the map.</li>
                    </ul>
                        Nevertheless, the placement of the bubbles should only be taken as an indication as the map is untangled in the beginning to
                        improve readability.
                        The placement of papers within a bubble has no specific meaning, 
                        as they are moved around significantly during the initial arrangement of the map to avoid overlap.

                        <span id="question-Q">Q6</span> Why does the overview visualization work better for some research topics than others?
                    </p>
                    <p>The visualization depends on the search results that we get for a given query.
                        If there are for example not enough articles on the topic, or if the metadata quality is low, this will impact the visualization.
                        We have a number of routines in place to improve your chances of getting a useful map, but we do not always succeed.

                        <span id="question-Q">Q7</span> How did Open Knowledge Maps come about?
                    </p>
                    <p>Open Knowledge Maps was founded by Peter Kraker in 2015. 
                        Peter had worked on knowledge domain visualizations in his PhD and developed the first version of 
                        <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart">the  open source visualization framework Headstart</a> out of frustration with the existing discovery tools for scientific knowledge.
                        In January 2016, Peter posted a <a class="underline" href="https://science20.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/call-for-collaborators-open-science-prize-project-on-open-discovery/" target="_blank">Call for Collaborators</a> 
                        on his blog, which brought a first team of volunteers together. Since 2016 Open Knowledge Maps is a <a class="underline" href="imprint">registered non-profit organization</a>.

                    <p>
                        Absolutely! Open Knowledge Maps is based on the open source software 
                        <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/OpenKnowledgeMaps/Headstart" target="_blank">Head Start</a>, which is able to create knowledge maps from a wide variety of data, including text, metadata and references.
