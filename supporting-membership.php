                        Supporting Membership for Organizations
                    </h2>
                    <p>Open Knowledge Maps is a charitable non-profit.
                        All of our services are free and open. There are no license fees and no lock-in effects. 
                        To provide a sustainable platform for open discovery, 
                        we propose to fund Open Knowledge Maps in a collective effort: 
                        organizations become supporting members and provide a yearly contribution. 
                        In return, our supporting members are invited to co-create the platform with us.

                        With more than 2.5 million papers published every year, discovery becomes increasingly difficult. 
                        Our revolutionary search engine enables researchers, students, and practitioners to quickly identify relevant resources. 
                        Instead of long, unstructured lists of search results, we create rich visual overviews of research topics, 
                        so-called knowledge maps. <a class="underline" href="about#advantages">Find out more about our discovery tool here.</a>

                        in any discipline based on 150+ million scientific outputs. 
                        Our services have been used by more than half a million users from all around the world. 
                        In addition, we have had more than 1,500 participants in 80 training events worldwide.

                        We build on library content and we dramatically increase the visibility and discoverability of this content by including 
                        sources and languages that many commercial products (including Google Scholar) do not index. 
                        Additionally, we collaborate with libraries 
                        in innovative open discovery projects.
