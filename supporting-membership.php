                <p><b>Open Knowledge Maps is a charitable non-profit</b> - we provide a free and open resource that dramatically increases 
                    the visibility of research findings for science and society alike. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the last 2.5 years, <b>Open Knowledge Maps has become the largest visual search engine for scientific knowledge in the world:</b> 
                    we have had more than half a million visits on the website, and more than 100,000 maps were created. In addition, we organized workshops 
                    with more than 1,000 participants worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Open Knowledge Maps <b>serves both users from the Global South and the Global North:</b> 
                    most of our users are from Indonesia, followed by the US, Germany, Austria, India, the UK, 
                    Canada, China and Australia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, <b>Open Knowledge Maps is an open infrastructure in a space that is dominated by closed and proprietary systems </b>[1].
                    These proprietary systems are often expensive and hinder innovation due to their closed nature. 
                    In contrast, Open Knowledge Maps software, content, and data can be easily reused - it is therefore community-owned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nevertheless, Open Knowledge Maps is still very much a volunteer effort. To provide a sustainable platform for open discovery, 
                    we propose to fund Open Knowledge Maps in a collective effort. 
                    <b>In this membership-based funding model, supporting organisations become members of Open Knowledge Maps and provide an annual contribution.</b> 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>In return, members get a say in the future development of Open Knowledge Maps.</b> As a member, you are invited to join the Board of Supporters, 
                    which participates in a yearly vote on what features and sources to implement. This establishes a true community-driven solution for the 
                    discovery of scientific knowledge.
                </p>
